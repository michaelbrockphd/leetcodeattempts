# LeetCode Attempts

As the name implies, this is a little repo of mine where I keep my LeetCode attempts (complete or still a work in progress.

This is no main module here, this Golang mod(ule) run only via the Golang test command.

For straight-up tests, use the following command.

```
$ go test -v
```

For benchmarked tests (time taken and memory allocated), use the following command.

```
$ go test -bench=. -benchmem
```

The table below details the tests in this Golang mod(ule).  Attempts will be made to try and keep it as current as possible.
